# 🎓 Face Academy - Teach AI to Recognize You!

> Transform from state-of-the-art research to a working web application in 48 hours! 

I decided to convert a groundbreaking research paper into a practical working project. This face recognition system is based on the revolutionary one-shot learning research from Carnegie Mellon University.

**📄 Research Paper**: [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)

## 🚀 What This Does

Ever wondered how your phone recognizes your face instantly? Face Academy does exactly that - but YOU get to build and train your own AI! It's a gamified web experience where you become the teacher and AI becomes your student.

### The Magic ✨

- **🎯 One-Shot Learning**: Show it 10 photos of yourself, and it learns to recognize you
- **🌐 Web-Based**: Works directly in your browser, no downloads needed
- **🎮 Gamified Experience**: Training feels like a fun interactive game
- **⚡ Real-Time**: Instant face recognition with confidence scores
- **🎓 Educational**: Learn how Siamese Neural Networks actually work

## 🎨 Unique Features

Unlike generic AI demos, Face Academy offers:

- **👨‍🎓 "Professor" Theme**: You're teaching AI, not just using it
- **🎪 Interactive Journey**: Welcome → Registration → Training → Testing → Graduation
- **🎆 Celebration Animations**: Confetti, progress bars, and achievement unlocks
- **📱 Social Sharing**: Share your AI training success on social media
- **🔬 Educational Context**: Links to research papers and technical explanations

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React + Framer Motion + TensorFlow.js
**Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
**Deployment**: GitHub Pages
**AI**: Siamese Neural Networks (your existing trained model)

## ⚡ Quick Start (Hackathon Style!)

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mian-abd/face-id.git
cd face-id
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a project
2. Run the SQL in `supabase-setup.sql` in your SQL Editor
3. Get your project URL and anon key

### 3. Configure Environment
Update `src/supabaseClient.js` with your Supabase credentials:
```javascript
const supabaseUrl = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL';
const supabaseAnonKey = 'YOUR_ANON_KEY';
```

### 4. Run Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## 🎯 User Journey

1. **🎊 Welcome Screen**: Animated introduction with floating orbs
2. **📝 Registration**: Collect username (and optional email)
3. **📸 Training Session**: Capture 10 photos with fun instructions
4. **🧠 AI Training**: Visual loading with "teaching AI" messages
5. **🔍 Recognition Test**: Real-time face verification
6. **🎓 Graduation**: Celebration with social sharing options

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**"AI Education Through Gamification"**

- **Neon-Futuristic Theme**: Purple gradients, gold accents, glowing effects
- **Orbitron Font**: Sci-fi typography for headings
- **Smooth Animations**: Framer Motion for delightful interactions
- **Progress Visualization**: Clear feedback at every step
- **Celebratory UX**: Make users feel accomplished

## 🗄️ Database Schema

```sql
-- Users table
users:
- id (uuid, primary key)
- username (unique)
- email (optional)
- model_status ('not_trained', 'training', 'trained', 'failed')
- model_trained_at (timestamp)
- created_at (timestamp)

-- Training images table  
training_images:
- id (uuid, primary key)
- user_id (foreign key)
- image_data (base64 string)
- image_type ('positive', 'anchor', 'negative')
- created_at (timestamp)
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **📱 Progressive Web App**: Offline functionality
- **🤖 Real TensorFlow.js Integration**: Use your actual trained model
- **👥 Multi-User Support**: Family/team accounts
- **📊 Analytics Dashboard**: Training success rates, user engagement
- **🎪 More Gamification**: Badges, leaderboards, challenges
